============================= Explanation of this Script's Job =============================
This script does the following:
  It touches new files based on the following rule:
  1) it copies the filename that has a certain/given extension;
  2) then it changes its extension by a fixed one that is name "empty";
  3) this new name is then touched (ie, it is created as a new empty file).
  4) optionally, instead of an empty file,
     the ".empty" file may contain a text line with the original filename
     (e.g.: "the file.mp4" is touched as "the file.empty" and inside a line as "the file.mp4")
  5) optionally, delete original files used for touch
An example:
  If extension chosen is "mp4" and a file named "abc.mp4" is present on the local folder,
  a new file named "abc.empty", if it does not exist previously, will be created empty.
  This, in fact, will be done for all files with extension "mp4" on the local folder.
  
Syntax:
  touchEncloseReplaceExtByEmpty.py [-e=<ext>] [-wi] [-d[
    where:
      -e=<ext> is the extension to be reached: if not given, default is "mp4".
      -wi [or --write-inside] is a marker for writing
                              the former filename into the .empty touched new file
      -d [or --delete] is a marker for deleting original files for empty-touching
                      (use this with care for there is not undoing it after deletion)

This scripted was updated:
  1) to Python 3
  2) to add the -wi functionality (-wi is for "writing inside")
on  2025-02-06 (its date creation is unknown, it may have been written in 2013)
