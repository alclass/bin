~/bin/dlYouTubeWhenThereAreDubbed.py

Obs:
  a) this script is currently located in the 'bin' repo
     and, inside $PATH, can be run everywhere in the system
  b) at some future moment (when DirTree becomes a pipx install),
     it will be moved to the DirTree repo. DirTree as a pipx install
     will also be availbable anywhere in the system.

This script uses (underlying) yt-dlp to download (from YouTube) a video
  in two or more languages.

  YouTube spoken-language-translations are, as far as we've noticed, autodubbed.

Observation about the auto-dubs and this script:

  1) if the video has only its original language available, no auto-dubs,
    this script is able to "fall back" to a one-language download;

  2) the fall-back is not "perfectly" perceived,
    at the time of writing any non-zero return from subprocess
    will make this script try a one-language download,

  3) but, if the non-zero return was caused by, say,
    a network fault, and the video is in fact multilanguage,
    the one-language attempt will also fail
    (attempting to download a multilanguage video with
     a one-language audiocode returns an error from YouTube).

Each language, dubbed or original, has its own separate audio-only-file
  that is 'fused' (or merged) to its video-only counterpart
  forming the language-dubbed video
  (@see example below)

Usage (this is about to receive some adjustments):
  (the --audioonlycodes will become --amn (for "audiomainnumber"))
  (the --map will be introduced)
  (the --videoonlycode will become --voc)
  (a sketch of this upgrade comes at the end)
======

Syntax:
  $dlYouTubeWhenThereAreDubbed.py [--ytid <ytid or yturl within "">]
    [--dirpath "<dirpath>"]
    [--useinputfile]
    [--voc <video-only-code-number>]
    [--amn <audio-main-number>]
    [--map <mapdict|dictionary-map-informing-sufixes-and-their-2-letter-language-codes>]
    [--seq <sequence-number-for-token-vdN-2letter>]

Where:
  <ytid> => the ENCODE64 11-character YouTube video id
    or a youtube-style URL with one but in the latter case
      it should come within "" (quotes) if it has an "&" (ampersand character)
      obs: the use of parameter --useinputfile looks for ytid's
           in a file named youtube-ids.txt in the working directory and ignores --ytid
  <video-format-number> => an integer representing the video-only-format
    default: this parameter defaults to 160 (a video-only-code having 256x144 resolution)
  <audiomainnumber> => the number of the audio-only-code with its dash-sufix-number
  <mapdict> => a dict mapping the dash-sufix-number with its corresponding two-letter-language-code (@see examples)
  <dirpath> is the absolute directory path from where the default download subdirectory resides
    obs: the download directory is a prenamed subdirectory inside <dirpath>
  <dictionary-map-informing-sufixes-and-their-2-letter-language-codes> => see the examples (above and below)
  <sequence-number-for-token-vdN-2letter> => a sequence number to be appended to "token" vd (example: seq=1 -> "vd1-en")

Older syntax (no longer valid):
  $dlYouTubeWhenThereAreDubbed.py [--ytid <ytid or yturl within "">]
    [--dirpath "<dirpath>"]
    [--useinputfile]
    [--videoonlycode <video-format-number>]
    --audioonlycodes <list of audio-format-codes>
    [--nvdseq <sequence-number-for-token-vdN-2letter>]

Example:
========

  1 - using audioparts (when an audio-only file is merged with a video-only file)
    $dlYouTubeWhenThereAreDubbed.py --ytid abcABC123-_
      --amn 233 -- --map "0:en,1:pt"

  2 - without audioparts (when the download file is already a+v merged)
    $dlYouTubeWhenThereAreDubbed.py --ytid abcABC123-_
      --voc 91 --amn -1 --map "0:en,1:pt"

The first example 'automatizes' the following two yt-dlp downloads:
  $yt-dlp -w -f 160+233-0 abcABC123-_
  $yt-dlp -w -f 160+233-1 abcABC123-_

The second example 'automatizes' the following two yt-dlp downloads:
  $yt-dlp -w -f 91-0 abcABC123-_
  $yt-dlp -w -f 91-1 abcABC123-_

Notice:
 1 - yt-dlp doesn't know about the two-letter-codes 'en' & 'pt', these are used later on for file renaming.
 2 - videoonlycode 160 though not given was set because it's the default
     (defaults are stll hardcoded at the time of writing, it may become a configurable in a config-file)

The result will be the download of two videofiles: one with the language audio 233-0
  and the other with the language audio 233-1 (be they original or autodubbed)
This automatization also takes care of the renaming needed
  because yt-dlp does not differentiate filenames by language audio

Care with the use of parameter --useinputfile:
=============================================
  if the user wants to download many videos at once, it can be done with --useinputfile,
    suffice a youtube-ids.txt is created with all the ytid's consolidated
  however, this script (and this is recited below) does not know beforehand if a video
   has or doesn't have a specific language for it, or more formally, it an audioonlycode fits it.

Explanation
===========

This script accepts the following input:
  1  a parameter for a youtube-video-id (ytid)
    1-1  alternatively, instead of a ytid, it may receive as input ytids in a text file (whose name is youtube-ids.txt)
  2 a parameter for the videoonlycode (--voc) (it's only one number, and it's an integer)
  4 a parameter for the audiomainnumber (--amn)
  5 a 'mapping' (--map), as text/string, telling each sufix represents which 2-letter-code language
    (example: '0: en, 1: pt' says sufix 0 is English and sufix 1 is Portuguese)
  6 the audioonlycode is formed by joining the `audiomainnumber` with its number sufix (given in the 'mapping')
    (example: audiomainnumber=249, sufix=0 (for English as in the example above), then audioonlycode="249-0"

Observation about (the lack of) standardization (the equalility) of audio format codes:
  As far as we've observed, these codes are not "fully" standardized
    For example, in general, a video that is autodubbed into English
      has sufix "-0" added to its audioonlycode (example: 233-0 or 234-0),
      but if the original audio is already English,
      it seems undeterminate what "dash-number" the YouTube (web) system will give to it
        example: it might be either a "-7", or a "-8" or a "-9"
        (ie, it's not a standard fixed dash-number for all cases)
        the user would have to find out and enter it via the audiocodes parameter

  This script as yet doesn't do an API asking for a mapping of language to audio-only format code

  On the other hand, what seems stable is when English is autodubbed and another language is the original
  In these cases, English gets a "-0" annexed to the audioonlycode and the original language gets a "-1"
    Examples:
       233-0 autodubbed English and 233-1 the original other language
       234-0 autodubbed English and 234-1 the original other language

This script downloads the video-only part exactly once and copies it to each new audio language piece.
This saves transfer bytes and redownload times, because the n-language resulting videos will be formed,
  each one, by joining its videopart (the same for all languages) with its audiopart (language by language).

For example:
  1 suppose a video with available autodubbed translation(s)
  2 suppose also that videoonlycode 160 is available
  3 suppose also that audioonlycodes are available in dubbed Italian (as 233-5) and in the original English (as 233-9)

Then, this script will:
  1st download the 160 video
  2nd copy it once (making two of them) because one will be used for Italian (it), the other for English (en)
  3rd download the 160+233-5, yt-dlp recognizes that the videopart is already present
    and proceeds to download only the audio "it" piece (yt-dlp then blends the audio with the videoonly)
  4th download the 160+233-9, idem for the "en" piece

An example of language audiocodes, having English as the original:
    (seen in a channel we visited) (notice that this pattern may not be a general rule):
    (this example shows only the dash-numbers for the audioonlycode 233)
  233-0  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [de-DE] Deutsch (Deutschland) - dubbed-auto
  233-1  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [es-US] es-US - dubbed-auto
  233-2  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [fr-FR] Français (France) - dubbed-auto
  233-3  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [hi] हिन्दी - dubbed-auto
  233-4  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [id] Indonesia - dubbed-auto
  233-5  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [it] Italiano - dubbed-auto
  233-6  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [ja] 日本語 - dubbed-auto
  233-7  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [pl] polski - dubbed-auto
  233-8  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [pt-BR] Português (Brasil) - dubbed-auto
  233-9  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [en-US] American English - original (default)

An example of language audiocodes, having Portuguese as the original:
    (seen in another channel we visited):
    (again it only shows the dash-numbers for the audioonlycode 233)
  233-0  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [en-US] American English - dubbed-auto
  233-1  mp4 audio only    m3u8 [pt-BR] Português (Brasil) - original (default)

This second case (where English is autodubbed) seems more stable in terms of standardized audiocodes.

The first case (where English is the original) seems to make English have
  either a "-9" (dash nine), most of the time,
  or "-8" (dash eight) sometimes.

The user has to use the audiocodes CLI parameter to tell the correct audiocodes (*).
  The default today uses [233-0, 233-1]
    and, as mentioned above, stable for when English is autodubbed
    and another language is the original.

 (*) to see the full list of CLI parameters for this script together with this docstr,
     run it with --docstr
     (parameter --help shows all parameters with a short description for each)
     (or scroll up the text to the beginning)

A programatic discovery of these audioonlycodes (mapping language to format code)
  via yt-dlp might be done in the future,
  but as yet this is not performed by this script

Notice as a reemphasis that in the first example above, the original English is 233-9
  and, in the second, English autodubbed, it's 233-0

===========
Limitation: what does this script not do (at least yet)?

  1 it doesn't discover the language codes,
    even less which codes for a certain video are available at all.
    (@see also docstr above)
    (The user may find out available format codes using the
      -F (or --format) parameter in yt-dlp.)
  2 it may not be able to check all problems from the command line, but if subprocess returns 0,
    it's a good sign that both the network is working and videos have "arrived" complete
    if 'subprocess' does not return with 0, at the time of writing,
      the program will halt showing its error message,
    (ie, this script does not yet treat non-0 return cases [*] in a better way)
    [*] imagining mostly that non-O returns are network problems or yt-dlp upgrade needs

On 2025-08-01:
  the main parts of this script were already in use
On 2025-09-23:
  thinking about an innovation to this script
  introducing the --map CLI parameter
  --map accepts a string like a dict without spaces, e.g.:
    => --map "0:en,1:pt"
  This informs the number sufixes for the audioonlycode and which languages those represent
  Because of that, parameter --audioonlycodes may also be changed:
    FROM: a list of "dashed" number (e.g. "[249-0, 249-1"])
    TO: a number  (e.g. "249")
  --audioonlycodes may become --audiomainnumber
On 2025-09-26:
  the parameters have been changed, the main code refactored (a new class now help form the audiocodes),
  it's running though some improvements are still needed "here and there".

Justification:
  the number of YouTube autodubbed available languages
    not only may vary from video to video (especially in English originals),
    but it may also grow in the future
      (for example: Russian appeared -- we haven't seen it before -- in some original-English videos)

    Discovers the filename of the downloaded yt-dlp file

    However, when a download is incomplete, the following info is important.

    The discovery process is easy when the download process in not interrupted,
      but tricky if the user is continuing a previous incomplete download.

    When a download process is completed, a prefix is prepended to the filenames.

    When download process is incomplete and the user restarts it,
      this script makes a "strong" supposition", .i.e., one
      to consider the canonical filename, if present, representing the video-only-file.

    * Chances are this is correct, but, if not, the user should restart from an empty directory.

    How to discovery works
    =======================

    Before making the "strong assumption" above, the script compares the directory contents
      looking for a new file (comparasion before versus after). This is the first try.

    The second try starts when, after the first try, a new recent file is not found.
    The second is based on a "strong supposition". This assumption may delineate as follows:
      1 - a previous download happened, but it's incomplete
      2 - a look-up for the canonical file in folder will be interpreted as the video-only-file

    The user should know this detail because if this hypothesis is wrong, the result may be wrong.
    Another hypothesis is a failure in the last renaming of the last run, i.e., the download was completed,
      and the user is restarting a new one actually without need.

    If the second try does not find a file, the third try asks the user which filename
      is the correct one.
